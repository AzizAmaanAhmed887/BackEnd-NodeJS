# BackEnd-NodeJS

This repository showcases work using Node.js. It includes the following features:

- Demonstrates the use of ES6 modules for importing and exporting functionality in JavaScript.
- Includes a utility `math.js` file that provides basic math operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and constants (`PI`, `g`).
- Showcases the use of the `random-words` package to generate random words for demonstration purposes.
- Provides example usage of the `figlet` library for ASCII art generation (note: requires the library to be installed separately).

   npm install
   ```
3. Import and use the functionality provided by the `math.js` module or other built-in dependencies (`random-words`).

## Example Usage

The `script.js` file demonstrates:

- Importing functions and constants from `math.js`.
- Usage of the `random-words` package to generate random words.
- Example setup to work with the `figlet` package (requires installation for usage).
